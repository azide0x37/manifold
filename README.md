**Manifold** is not just another calendar library‚Äîit's the missing link between your 3D world and the 4th dimension of time. Leverage the power of iCal standards and cutting-edge spatial algorithms to craft multidimensional experiences in scheduling, project management, and beyond.

### Features ‚ú®

- **Import from iCal**: Effortlessly synchronize your existing calendars with a single function call.
  
- **Multidimensional Events**: Events in Manifold are not restricted to just date, time, and place‚Äîthey exist in a 4D manifold.

- **Reference Frames**: Tag events with multiple reference frames and switch between them with ease.

- **Fully Typed**: Written in TypeScript, providing built-in type safety and auto-completion in modern editors.

- **Unit Tested**: Comes with a comprehensive test suite to ensure rock-solid reliability.

### Quick Start üöÄ

```bash
npm install manifold-time
```

Here's how to import an iCal and convert it into a 4D manifold:

```typescript
import { importICal, WorldLine } from 'manifold-time';

const worldLine = new WorldLine();

importICal(worldLine, iCalString);
```
